Lightweight and highly customizable plugin that aims to stop attacks on your BungeeCord server quickly and efficiently.

## Getting started
### Information
This is a free BungeeCord antibot plugin made to protect your server against most of bot attacks [MCSpam/MCStorm/etc...]

After buying a lot of antibots with none of them working as I expected, I decided to create my own antibot and make it free. Everyone needs to be safe, bot attacks in Minecraft servers are really common these days.

This plugin was mainly made for ArkFlame Network, but I published it because I wanted to help people protect their own servers.
